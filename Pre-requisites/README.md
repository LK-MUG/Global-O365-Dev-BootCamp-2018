# Developer Pre-requisites

# Set up your Office 365 tenant

To build and deploy client-side web parts using the SharePoint Framework, you need an Office 365 tenant. 

If you don't have one, you can get an Office 365 developer subscription when you join the [Office 365 Developer Program]( https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program?ocid=BootCamp2018_DevProg). See the [Office 365 Developer Program documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/office-365-developer-program) for step-by-step instructions about how to join the Office 365 Developer Program and sign up and configure your subscription.  

> [!NOTE] 
> Make sure that you are signed out of any existing Office 365 tenants before you sign up for the Office 365 Developer Program.


# Set up your SharePoint Framework development environment

## Install developer tools

### Install NodeJS

Install [NodeJS LTS version](https://nodejs.org). 

### Install Visual Studio Code

You can use any code editor or IDE that supports client-side development to build your web parts. For our Office365 Bootbamp labs, we will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Install Git command line tools
[Git source control tools](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone our starter repo
### Create a working folder
Create a working folder where you want to work on the bootcamp SharePoint Framework labs. We recommend using a simple folder structure, something like "c:\Work\bootcamp" on Windows, or "~/code/bootcamp" on a Mac.

### Clone the repository from Github
Open a command prompt in your working folder, and then run the following command:
```sh
git clone [todo: git link for the repo with bootcamp starters]
```
