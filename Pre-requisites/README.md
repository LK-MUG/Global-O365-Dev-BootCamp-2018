# Developer Pre-requisites


# Set up your Office 365 tenant

To build and deploy client-side web parts using the SharePoint Framework, you need an Office 365 tenant. 

If you don't have one, you can get an Office 365 developer subscription when you join the [Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program). See the [Office 365 Developer Program documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/office-365-developer-program) for step-by-step instructions about how to join the Office 365 Developer Program and sign up and configure your subscription.  

> [!NOTE] 
> Make sure that you are signed out of any existing Office 365 tenants before you sign up for the Office 365 Developer Program.
